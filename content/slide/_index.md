# Drawing 6:

![Drawing 10](fruits.jpeg)

*After my initial cartoon drawings i decided to switch it up and decide something more real- i chose a bowl of fruits. Surprisingly, this has turned out as one of my favourite pieces, by using different shades for the objects i managed to add a 3D effect making them look somewhat real.*
