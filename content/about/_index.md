![Drawing 1](Mosque.jpeg)

*This was drawn at the start of lockdown. It is a drawing of the Sheikh Zayed Mosque in Abu Dhabi - the capital of the United Arab Emirates. The marble white tiles of the mosque boldly contrast with the bright blue sky which is one of its most beautfiul features.*

*Quite a few of my pieces started off as cartoons which i was most confident in drawing, which is why there are many cartoons here. Scooby Doo was one of my favourite cartoons so i decided to draw it!*
