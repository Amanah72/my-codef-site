# Architecture:

![Drawing 1](Mosque.jpeg)

*This was drawn at the start of lockdown. It is a drawing of the Sheikh Zayed Mosque in Abu Dhabi - the capital of the United Arab Emirates. The marble white tiles of the mosque boldly contrast with the bright blue sky which is one of its most beautfiul features.*
- **Date:** Mar 2020
- **Size:** A3
- **Style:** Drawn and coloured with pencils
-**Time spent creating:** I did this over around 2 weeks spending a few hours each day with a few breaks. (Colouring the sky took a long time!)
