*This piece was one of the first drawings i created which i shared publicly (via Instagram). It received lots of positive feedback so i decided to create more. I was inspired to do this by a DVD cover of a Tom and Jerry film haha!- beside the whole drawing you can see a zoom in smiley Jerry! :)*

*Quite a few of my pieces started off as cartoons which i was most confident in drawing, which is why there are many cartoons here. Scooby Doo was one of my favourite cartoons so i decided to draw it! However, i think im now more interested in drawing landscapes/buildings.*

*This was also inspired by a DVD cover. When i was bored in the summer holidays i would just draw random cartoons from movie covers, and this is another example of that.*
